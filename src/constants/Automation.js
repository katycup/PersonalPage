This project was part of the WIPANO project, the goal is to define a standard for the determination of 
safety characteristics for hybrid mixtures.`;

export const Story = `During my Bachelor's degree I joined the second-largest metrology institute in the world - 
“Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt”. While there, I successfully automated a complex experimental setup for dust and vapor explosions in a 20-l chamber, while adhering to rigorous safety standards.`;

export const Achiv1 =`I fully automated the experimental explosion process of dust, vapor, and hybrid mixture 
explosions in a 20l sphere using LabView. `;
export const Achiv2 =`To this day over 500 successful explosions and measurements were completed.`;

export const Achiv3 =`Multiple Papers were published and a norm is in the process of being approved.`;

export const sphere1= `This exact experimental setup is used by four German companies among them the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), as well as laboratories from Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Poland and P.R. China. Among all companies and institutions, we had the only fully automated experimental setup. The results will have an impact on the new standard and may lead to robust data for later simulation purposes.`;
