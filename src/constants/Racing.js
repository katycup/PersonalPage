export const racingTeam =`The wob-racing team is an interdisciplinary project for students at Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences. Since 2003, the team has been working on the concept, design, construction, and testing of a Formula Student race car every year. The team started with rear-wheel-drive vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, based on a self-supporting steel lattice frame. Since 2011, they have been building fully electric race cars. Since 2018, these cars are based on a carbon monocoque with electric all-wheel drive and hub motors. The project is shaped by students from all faculties from beginning to end. Together with sponsors and manufacturers, they create race cars that can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 2.2 seconds, faster than Formula 1. Additionally, their current project, the WR17, will soon be capable of autonomous driving.`;

I also handled the planning of the circuit board and the development of software components for communication via the CAN bus in the car, as well as displaying essential information for the driver.`;
